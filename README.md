The dataset you're referring to is for the purpose of automating the loan eligibility process based on customer details provided in online application forms. Here's a breakdown of the dataset:

### Dataset Information:

- **Objective:** Automate the loan eligibility process in real-time using customer details from online application forms.
  
- **Files:** 
  - `train_csv`: Used to train the model.
  - `test.csv`: Used for predicting outcomes from the trained dataset.

### Columns in `train_csv`:

- The dataset comprises various columns including:
  - `Loan_ID`: Unique identifier for each customer's loan application.
  - `Loan_Status`: The target variable indicating loan approval (Y/N).
  - Other features such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, etc., which are used as predictors for the loan approval status.

### Source and Acknowledgments:

- **Source:** The dataset was obtained from the Analytics Vidhya website for practicing loan eligibility.
  
- **Acknowledgments:** The contributor thanks their friends for assistance and acknowledges Analytics Vidhya for providing the practice session.

### Inspiration and Tasks:

- **Inspiration:** The goal is to build a binary classification model to predict the loan approval status (approved or not approved).
  
- **Tasks:** 
  - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics and relationships between variables.
  - Conduct Data Preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.
  - Build and validate predictive models for loan approval status.
  - Perform Feature Engineering to potentially enhance model accuracy by creating new features or modifying existing ones.

### Submission Details:

- **Submission Requirement:** The final submission file needs to be in CSV format, containing two variables: `Loan_ID` and `Loan_Status`.
